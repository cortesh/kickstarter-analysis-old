# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to investigate how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals using the Kickstarter dataset. This will be accomplished by analysing outcomes by launch date and goal amounts.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A summary table was created to count theater campaigns broken out by outcomes grouped by month irrespective of year to investigate whether month or time of year of the start of a campaign played a role in its success or failure.  A line chart displays the distribution of outcomes over time.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this analysis, play campaigns were grouped into categories based on the goal amount.  These counts were then compared as a percentage of the total.  Finally, these results were plotted on a number line to visualize their relation to each other across all amount categories.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
A cursory examination of the results from the outcomes by launch date suggests that May is by far the most successful month to launch a campaign, While December seems to be the worst month to begin a new campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It appears that taken as a whole, success rates are corrolated to the goal amount.  The greater the goal, the greater the chances for failure.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

While this is generally true across the data set, the ranges 25000-29999 and 35000-39999 seem to run contrary to this trend and would require additional analysis to isolate the apparent outliers.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Further analysis might run a standard regression to isolate outliers in the outcome by goal dataset.
